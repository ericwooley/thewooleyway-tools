## Projects
* [@tww/Terminus Maximus](https://github.com/thewooleyway/thewooleymeta/tree/master/packages/terminus-maximus) - Organized Concurrent scripts!
* [@tww/up-resolve](https://github.com/thewooleyway/thewooleymeta/tree/master/packages/up-resolve) - resolve files by walking up the directory tree.
* [@tww/config](https://github.com/thewooleyway/thewooleymeta/tree/master/packages/config) - Resolves and combines one or more config files, prioritizing configurations described in the closest directory.
* [comp-val](https://github.com/thewooleyway/thewooleymeta/tree/master/packages/cval) - Composable Validation Library! Although, it doesn't really do anything that [revalidate](https://github.com/jfairbank/revalidate) doesn't do. I didn't discover revalidate until after I created this. Still its here, in case you want to use it.
